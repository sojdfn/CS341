The Code Coverage 
 




CalcInterestTest.java

The code coverage for the CalcInterestTest.java is divided into expected to pass and expected to fail. The reason i have made it like that is because the correct test cases will help that my code is working as planned and the failing test cases help in making that it outputs the failed results as expected.

As depicted in the above image my corrected results give me 100 % code coverage stating that all the code and statement are verified and validated by the test cases.
